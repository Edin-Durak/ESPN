# ESPN---Revizija

I recreated one of ESPN's web pages for practice.
In this project, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The web page is fully responsive for all screen sizes.
The header is made with a menu icon for smaller screens, and on larger screens, it disappears.
In this project, I practiced absolute positioning.
I added a video and positioned it as a background video using absolute positioning, and made it responsive for all screens.
